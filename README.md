# Java Data Structures Learning Project

A comprehensive Java project for learning and exploring fundamental data structures with extensive documentation and examples.

## Overview

This project provides implementations of core data structures in Java with a focus on clear, well-documented code to facilitate learning. Each data structure is implemented in its own module with detailed comments explaining the concepts, operations, and time/space complexity.

## Data Structures Included

1. **Linked List**
   - Singly linked list implementation with comprehensive operations
   - Time and space complexity analysis for each operation
   - Insertion, deletion, search, and traversal operations

2. **Heaps**
   - Max Heap implementation
   - Min Heap implementation
   - Heap operations like insertion, extraction, and heapify
   - Priority queue functionality

3. **Binary Trees**
   - General binary tree implementation
   - Tree traversals (in-order, pre-order, post-order, level-order)
   - Tree properties and operations (height, size, mirror, etc.)

4. **Binary Search Trees (BST)**
   - Complete BST implementation with search, insert, and delete operations
   - Tree balancing concepts
   - In-order traversal for sorted output
   - Successor and predecessor functionality

5. **Graphs**
   - Adjacency list representation for both directed and undirected graphs
   - Graph traversals (BFS, DFS)
   - Shortest path algorithms (Dijkstra's)
   - Minimum spanning tree (Prim's algorithm)
   - Topological sorting for directed acyclic graphs

6. **Trie**
   - Prefix tree implementation for efficient string operations
   - Insert, search, and delete operations
   - Autocomplete functionality
   - Common prefix finding
